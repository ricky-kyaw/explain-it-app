A full-stack, serverless web application that simplifies complex topics using generative AI, built entirely on the AWS cloud with Amplify.

# What It Does
This application serves as a hands-on guide to building modern cloud applications. It allows authenticated users to input any complex topic and receive a simple, easy-to-understand explanation, as if for a five-year-old.
The primary goal of this project was to explore the end-to-end process of developing with AWS Amplify, making it a perfect foundation for workshops that aim to make cloud and AI technologies more accessible to students and enthusiasts.

# ‚ú® Core Features
- Secure Authentication: Full sign-up and sign-in flow using Amazon Cognito.
- Generative AI: Integrates with Amazon Bedrock to provide explanations from Anthropic's Claude 3 Haiku model.
- Serverless Backend: Built with AWS Lambda and API Gateway for a scalable, cost-effective backend.
- Modern UI: A clean, responsive interface created with React and Material-UI.
- Automated Deployments: A full CI/CD pipeline managed by the AWS Amplify Console for automatic deployments on every code change.
